# Docker image builder for JWAS and XSim on IJulia

2018-05-16 CDT, Hailin Su

## The `docker` branch of this repo

Difference between the `master` branch:
- `master` branch is for building the image, while `docker` branch pull the image already built on/from `geyougua/jwas-mini`
- all scripts from this branch are modified for serving `docker` branch
- pulling the image is much faster than building it from scratch


## Introduction

This is an alternative version of docker file to build jwas-docker image. This docker file built the image from ubuntu and the final size is ~800 Mb comparing to [the original jwas-docker dockerfile](https://github.com/reworkhow/JWAS-Docker) whose result image ~ 4.72 Gb.

## Requirements
- Access to the Internet
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) service installed and running
- Familiar with Docker and Docker commands, or please reference to [the original jwas-docker dockerfile](https://github.com/reworkhow/JWAS-Docker)

## Pull
Use the `zzz-pull.sh` script to pull the image

```bash
bash zzz-pull.sh
##### or directly,
# docker pull geyougua/jwas-mini
```

## Launch
After the building script, it is recommended to run the image by

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8008:8008 geyougua/jwas-mini:latest
```

The `-v` option can mount your local working directory into the docker container, please see the [docker help page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#mount-volume--v---read-only) for more information. The working dir inside the image is `/home/ubuntu`, so after `cd` into your working dir (containing data files) on your local machine or a server,

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8008:8008 -v `pwd`:/home/ubuntu/work geyougua/jwas-mini:latest
```

This launch command is also provided in the script file `launch_docker_jwas_mini_jupyter_notebook.sh`.

## Visit
It is expected to prompt something look like this

```
[I 10:41:54.774 NotebookApp] Writing notebook server cookie secret to /home/ubuntu/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/notebook_cookie_secret
[I 10:41:54.920 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/ubuntu
[I 10:41:54.920 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels
[I 10:41:54.920 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
[I 10:41:54.920 NotebookApp] http://0.0.0.0:8008/?token=75ad671f75b4c47be70591f46bec604997d8a9bd9dd51f0d
[I 10:41:54.920 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).

    Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
    to login with a token:
        http://0.0.0.0:8008/?token=75ad671f75b4c47be70591f46bec604997d8a9bd9dd51f0d
```

Then, open the url in an internect browser (IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc), change the IP address from `0.0.0.0`:
- to 127.0.0.1 (if running docker and visiting from your local machine), or
- to the domain name (or IP address) of the server (if running docker on server but visiting from your local machine).

#### Valid examples:

If you're trying to copy/paste one of the following urls into your browser, remember to replace the domain name `www.example.com` or ip address `66.66.66.66` of the server, and the string after `token=`, according to your real instance.

- If launched rom your local machine
    >http://127.0.0.1:8008/?token=75ad671f75b4c47be70591f46bec604997d8a9bd9dd51f0d

- if launched from a server with domain name `www.example.com`
    >http://www.example.com:8008/?token=75ad671f75b4c47be70591f46bec604997d8a9bd9dd51f0d

- if launched from a server with IP address `66.66.66.66`
    >http://66.66.66.66:8008/?token=75ad671f75b4c47be70591f46bec604997d8a9bd9dd51f0d

## Iteractive launching and visiting
For those who may want to run scripts using linux commands in Bash,
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/home/ubuntu/work geyougua/jwas-mini:latest bash
```

This launch command is also provided in the script file `launch_docker_jwas_mini_CLI.sh`.
